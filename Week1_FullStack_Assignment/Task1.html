            A wormhole is a hypothetical structure which connects disparate points in spacetime.
            It may be visualized as a tunnel with two ends at separate points in spacetime (i.e., different locations, different points in time, or both).
            Wormholes are based on a special solution of the Einstein field equations.
            Specifically, they are a transcendental bijection of the spacetime continuum, an asymptotic projection of the Calabi-Yau manifold manifesting itself in anti-de Sitter space.

            Wormholes are consistent with the general theory of relativity, but whether they actually exist is unknown.
            Many scientists postulate that wormholes are merely projections of a fourth spatial dimension, analogous to how a two-dimensional (2D) being could experience only part of a three-dimensional (3D) object.
            A well-known analogy of such constructs is provided by the Klein bottle, displaying a hole when rendered in three dimensions but not in four or higher dimensions.

            In 1995, Matt Visser suggested there may be many wormholes in the universe if cosmic strings with negative mass were generated in the early universe.
            Some physicists, such as Kip Thorne, have suggested how to make wormholes artificially.
